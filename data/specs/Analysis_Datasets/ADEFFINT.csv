,,,,,,,,,,"XW 2/14/2025:  Please noted that the critetia of missing 2 consecutive assessments for cohort 3 (PFS by BIRC per PCWG3) is different from others (PFS per RECIST 1.1). You need to identity whether it's PD by CT/MRI scan or PD by Bone scan. If it's PD by CT/MRI, then censor for missing 2 consecutive CT/MRI. If it's PD by Bone scan, then censor for missing 2 consecutive Bone scan. I would suggest create separate variables for this analysis, and also create a variable to determine the type of PD."
