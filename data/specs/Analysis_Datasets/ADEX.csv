Do not impute partial dates where ECTRT in  ('Nivolumab', 'Ipilimumab', 'Relatlimab/Nivolumab FDC'). Instead, file a data issue.

In the event of partial dates for oral medications (ECTRT = ""XL092""), sort records in EC domain by: year(ECSTDTC), year(ECENDTC), month(ECSTDTC), month(ECENDTC), day(ECSTDTC), day(ECENDTC). For the purposes of sorting, if month and/or year is missing from ECSTDTC and is non-missing from ECENDTC, or vice versa, use the opposite date component in the sort (e.g. if month of ECENDTC is missing and month of ECSTDTC is non-missing, use month of ECSTDTC in place of month(ECENDTC) for sorting). If day-part of either date is missing and is non-missing from the other, and the month-parts of the dates are the same, then use the opposite day-part in the sort. If the month-parts differ, set day-part of ECSTDTC (for sort only) to the 1st of the month if missing. Set day-part of ECENDTC (for sort only) to the last day of the month if missing. 

After sorting, impute partial ECSTDTC values as follows:
(1) Define ""previous dosing milestone” as the latest of (a) the chronologically previous end date (ADEX.AENDT) or (b) the date of first dose (ADSL.TRTSDT).
