ADaM: ADSL",Include all records in CM domain.,"ML 3/31/2023: Currently we don't have CMRGMNUM key variable in ADCM. APREGNUM was recently added to CRF to ""History of anti-cancer therapy"" page. We will update ODS specs to include APREGNUM in HTCDBL. Once HTCDBL is updated, I will inform Allucent to update SDTM.CD.
